# Doors, the Almighty Gatekeepers

Those **"Automatic Doors"** between outside world and D2 is one of the most notorious if not THE MOST NOTORIOUS DOOR EVER. The D2 door is so infamous that it has become a running joke among the students to the point it's part of RealAD's skit. 

For a door that is supposedly "automatic", it sure has a lot of quirks and peculiarities that make it feel like it has a mind of its own. Some days, it bends and heeds your presence, opening up as you approach with a warm welcome. Other days, it seems to be in a rebellious mood, refusing to budge no matter how much you wave your arms or stomp your feet. 

> Only after using a considerable amount of force would it open up, as if to say *"Fine, you win this time."*
