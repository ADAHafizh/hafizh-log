# Recalibrating our Pop Culture Anchor 

Although I cannot call myself a devout "steampunker", I very much enjoy narratives and world building on this specific vision of alternate realities. Partially because I do not find tall skyscrapers shrouded in thousand-glimmering neon lights to be enticing compared to mechanical whirrs, clanks, and lung filling steam, but `because it is an era we will never see again. `

Unhinged take but our world today takes shape after modernism and standardism in the sense that a lot of things are shaping from this culture. Most of the ideas came from the West, and through long history, is applied in almost every inch of the world with varying "success". **Take for example McDonalds. **All across the globe, they have transformed from a red-yellow playful hunger-grabbing food sites into a souless concrete structure with a yellow "M" sign posted somewhere in the vicinity.

Knowing this, it also applies to steampunk in the discourse that steampunk works are often set in an alternative history of the Victorian era or the American frontier where steam power remains in mainstream use, or in a fantasy world that similarly employs steam power. Authors like Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, Mary Shelley, and Edward S. Ellis contributed to the popularity of the genre. But just because the idea popularized in the "West", does not mean the "East" have no `steampunk`.
