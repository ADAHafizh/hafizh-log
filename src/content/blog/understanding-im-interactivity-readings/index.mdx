# Prologue

In the spirit of continuing my previous discussion on whether an artwork should be interactive or not ([here](https://hafizh-log.vercel.app/blog/understanding-im-w2)), after reading the materials provided in this week's module, I would like to share my thoughts on the readings, specifically focusing on the asking a simple but perhaps provocative question:

# How far can you take someone else to an alternate reality?
