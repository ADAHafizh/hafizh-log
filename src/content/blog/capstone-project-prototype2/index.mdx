# Visual board

I just made a visual board on Notion, check out [here](https://www.notion.so/adh10023/visuals-inspo-deck-2fe84769b496802498b7d512b87d268c?source=copy_link). But essentially, I want the visuals moving forward to contain elements of natural motion, while also pertaining the concept between borderless and calmness. The way I do it first was to go to Behance and quickly gloss over similar keywords.
