# Giga Arcade? Mega Arcade?

As the class majority agreed that we will proceed with video games as the theme for the final machine, I began to spun my brain to see if there's some interesting thing that we can bring to the table. A thought crossed my mind to create **a giant "wayback machine"** which is just a big arcade machine compiling multiple "retro" games.
