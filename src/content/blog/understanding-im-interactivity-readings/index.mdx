# Prologue

In the spirit of continuing my previous discussion on whether an artwork should be interactive or not ([here](https://hafizh-log.vercel.app/blog/understanding-im-w2)), after reading the materials provided in this week's module, I would like to share my thoughts on the readings, specifically focusing on the asking a simple but perhaps provocative question:

# How far can you take someone to an alternate reality?

Interactive artworks are ones that are capable of 'reacting' to the audience's actions. This reaction comes in various forms, from a simple thought to a complex  response involving participatory of human senses. 

In class, we discussed how the Dada(s) challenged 'conventional' art by introducing randomness and chance into their works. This idea of randomness and chance can be seen as the foundation for interactivity, where the audience's actions can influence the outcome of the artwork.

One point that I take away from this phenomenon is that some Dadaists challenged the conventional prenotion of art: `a static object that can only evoke thoughts and emotions.` and instead wished for a higher form of engagement, where the audience can actively participate in the **creation of the artwork.** I believe both are interactive in their own way, but the latter offers a more 'immersive' experience.

    <p> This <i>'more immersive experience'</i> is what I would like to explore further, to which I call as <b>'alternate reality'.</b> </p>
