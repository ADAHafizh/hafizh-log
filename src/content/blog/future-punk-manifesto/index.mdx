# Welcome to Galactic Century 3179

The Third War was too much for the skies, earth, ocean, and humans to handle. What remains of the Past World gathered as one to form the United Council, which aims to revoke humanities previous sins. After the United Council declared the bannings of all "static" nuclear weapons, the world entered a new era of peace and prosperity. Some parted for the glittering stars amidst the skies while some stayed to walk earth's soil.

# In this Earth, nukes are soulful creatures

Nuclear weapons are no longer static, cold, and emotionless means of desire or conquest. They have evolved into soulful creatures that can think, feel, and communicate. They are no longer tools of destruction but rather beings that can coexist with humans. They have their own *personalities, emotions, and desires* just like a human being.

### Teacher's Log: 04 Aug 2179

> Today is my first day of work at [REDACTED] Academy located in Roams Island. I'm excited to meet my students and start teaching them. I wonder what they look like. Apparently, the Head Master is away for an emergency. The Vice President will be taking over from now on until further notice. Unfortunately, my class is not on the main building but in the city's outskirts. Guess I'll have to walk for a while to get there.

### Teacher's Log: 12 Aug 2179

> It's been a week since I started teaching here. To be fair, they all look like normal kids: laughing, joking, nagging about homework. I guess the brief I got during the job interview was just a joke. Or I wish, that's what I thought.
