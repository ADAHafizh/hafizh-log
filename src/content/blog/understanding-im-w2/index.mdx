# Doors, the Almighty Gatekeepers

Those **"Automatic Doors"** between outside world and D2 is one of the most notorious if not THE MOST NOTORIOUS DOOR EVER. The D2 door is so infamous that it has become a running joke among the students to the point it's part of RealAD's skit.

For a door that is supposedly "automatic", it sure has a lot of quirks and peculiarities that make it feel like it has a mind of its own. Some days, it bends and heeds your presence, opening up as you approach with a warm welcome. Other days, it seems to be in a rebellious mood, refusing to budge no matter how much you wave your arms or stomp your feet. 

> Only after using a considerable amount of force would it open up, as if to say *"Fine, you win this time."*

This door is a two part circus: First, it represents Wiener's cybernetics concept where the user does an input, the door mechanism controls the door's movement, and the feedback is the door opening or closing. However, the door's inconsistent behavior adds an element of **unpredictability**, making it a source of frustration and amusement for those who encounter it.

# Every artwork by default is Interactive

As we discussed in class, there are two ways to interpret interactivity. One, we can think of it in the broader terms and say that as long as the artwork conveys a message, it is interactive. Two, we can narrow down the definition to only consider interactivity when human participatory is involved. 

> **My stance on this matter is that so long as the artwork is capable of being "experienced" by the audience, it is considered interactive.** 

To further elaborate, I believe that even if there are no direct human participation, if the artwork envokes emotions, thoughts, or reactions from the audience, it is still interactive. For example, the artwork in front of D1. Just by passing the statue, it is likely that a thought crosses a person: "*what is this swirling thing about?*"
The reaction coming from seeing the artwork is what makes it interactive. But whether there will be a deeper engagement/feedback depends on the person. Will they engage in a discourse talking to peers about the artwork? Will they approach the plaque next to the statue and read the author's intent? Or will they take a picture with it and post it on social media? All of these are possible reactions that can stem from the initial interaction of seeing the artwork.
