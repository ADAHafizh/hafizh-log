# After the Break

Reading and contemplating the feedbacks we received after the presentation before the break gave us some insights and touchpoints that we should really focus now that the deadline is round the corner. Currently, our project, `Senspace` is suffering from trying to please and jamming everything into a single pot. I think at least we can focus on three important things:

- **Visuals**
- **Tactility**
- **Calm Technology-Ambience-esque**

The way that we will bring these three elements together is by bringing users to a calm state through `"ritualistic" ; "stepwise" ; "algorithmic"` instructions. We are still jotting down the details but one way were thinking about this is as follows:

> Before the users enter the space, we ask them to take off their shoes. Upon entering, they will walk on stone tiles, then they arrive in a patch of grass. Atop the grass, there are cushions: bean bags, pillows, where one can sit. Through relaxed state, we encourage users to look up, contemplate, and ponder over the projected space sky in the ceiling. 

# What we tried:

So, there are a lot of stuff that we need to prepare if we are heading towards the direction implied above. We have yet to fully breakdown each step, but let's say for now, here are some of the elements that we need to apply in our project:

1 - **Thinking about lights**
2 - **Nature around us**
3 - **Ambience, Sounds, and Feel**
