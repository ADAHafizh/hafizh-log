# DC Motor and Potentiometers. 

For this week's testing with DC Motor, I found it intriguing with some problems that came along with it, and somehow the method to fixing it just *works?* Anyhow, I began by continuing off from last week's code when the machine was working fine. Then, I added a potentiometer to `control the speed` and `direction.` 

Initially, after tweaking some parts of the code to fit the potentiometer, the motor suddenly stopped working and had no sounds coming off of it. When I checked the potentiometer using `Serial.write`, I noticed that it was jumping up and down in a weird fashion. Somewhere afterwards, I changed the potentiometer and/or then plugged it directly into the Arduino board to see if it would fix anything.

Funny enough, this caused some weird movement and whirring sounds when plugged (and tried with the new code). Then, I fiddled around with the input locations both in code and wiring, and somehow it worked??? Not sure how this turned out to be.
