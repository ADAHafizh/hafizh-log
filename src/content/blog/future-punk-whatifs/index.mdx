# Love.exe 
This scenario reminds me a lot of K from Bladerunner 2049 and his relationship with Joi. To be fair, my “aha” moment here is when I realize that the future isn’t that far, that is today. Truth to be told, love is such a commodity nowadays with many platforms allowing exchanges between individual to individual(s), or using LLMs to talk to an “imaginary partner”. 

# The Silent Intuition
My thoughts on this were quite the contrary to oneself but to the machine. How much trust should we put on the machine such that it would dictate one’s embodiment? This would honestly slap hard as an anime or sci-fi movie. Imagine the plot is something like this: in this techno future, the profiling is used to determine whether a person is going to commit crimes. Then, the protagonist justiciar discovers a fault in the system, and how certain parties are using this advantage to control the population. Dayum~

# Love Deficit
Around a year ago, Japan implemented the Tokyo Enmusubi, an “AI-powered” dating app meant to combat the declining birth rate. To quote, “while some people may be wary of sharing their personal information with private dating apps due to the prevalence of dating scams, an official app sponsored by the government could allay these fears.” is such a dystopian phrase to me. Love, and at the essence of it, to ensure humanity’s longevity, shouldn’t be a restriction. How come that we have survived countless droughts, famines, existential crises, yet in the current century, we are facing a decline unlike before? 

# The Economy of Being
If everyone is Buddha, does that mean no one's Buddha? What I am afraid of in this future is not that everyone is enlightened, it’s that it lowers what being enlightened means. The entire purpose of reaching this state is to let go of overworldly things, and yet, quantifying it does the exact opposite. Meaning is formed when there is a deficit, when everything’s meaningful, is it still meaningful? 

# The Plural Sanctum
I’m not sure about my take on this one. Because looking at history and present society, mixing things into the same hot pot hasn’t produced anything well. But if anything, this one has the most positive outlook to me as in the end, isn’t that what we’re kinda doing as well? True, we might now be mixing things into the same pot, but interpretations and findings are always found within these texts such that the knowledge keeps expanding beyond the originals. If anything, this is the most positive outlook on the scenarios.
