# Smarter State Machines

Continuing from previous post, I've redone the way I implement the state machine moving forward. This time, I used Touchdesigner's [network](https://derivative.ca/UserGuide/Network) systems output and selecting them through user input that is determined by a group of CHOPs. For summary, essentially I split the workload into three modules: 

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 5px;">
    <figure style="text-align: center;">

</div> 

- **State Controllers:** The brain that determines and knows what state entire network is, controlled (for now) with `keyboard input.` Will be using real-time data stream from sensors in the future.  
- **Visual Network: ** The place where I assemble all of the visuals, they can be entered through scrolling. Each are independent with one another.
- **Preview Node: ** A node that allows the user to see what is the current and next selection of visual.

# Visuals: Idle, Calm, Active prototypes

When the audience looks at the space, they will be greeted with a "living" voronoi waves from previous prototype that I have adjusted the colors and behavior such that it is attractive and active enough to be noticed by the audience. Originally, it had a dark color background, but considering the color palette we've discussed for the "calm" state, `I tried experimenting with making sure that the audience's eyes don't get flashbang-ed.`
