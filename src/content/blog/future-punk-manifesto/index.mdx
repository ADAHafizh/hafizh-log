# Welcome to Galactic Century 3179

The Third War was too much for the skies, earth, ocean, and humans to handle. What remains of the Past World gathered as one to form the United Council, which aims to revoke humanities previous sins. After the United Council declared the bannings of all "static" nuclear weapons, the world entered a new era of peace and prosperity. Some parted for the glittering stars amidst the skies while some stayed to walk earth's soil.

# In this Earth, nukes are soulful creatures

Nuclear weapons are no longer static, cold, and emotionless means of desire or conquest. They have evolved into soulful creatures that can think, feel, and communicate. They are no longer tools of destruction but rather beings that can coexist with humans. They have their own *personalities, emotions, and desires* just like a human being.

### Teacher's Log: 04 Aug 2179

> Today is my first day of work at [REDACTED] Academy located in Roams Island. I'm excited to meet my students and start teaching them. I wonder what they look like. Apparently, the Head Master is away for an emergency. The Vice President will be taking over from now on until further notice. Unfortunately, my class is not on the main building but in the city's outskirts. Guess I'll have to walk for a while to get there.

### Teacher's Log: 12 Aug 2179

> It's been a week since I started teaching here. To be fair, they all look like normal kids: laughing, joking, nagging about homework. I guess the brief I got during the job interview was just a joke. Or I wish, that's what I thought.

> One morning, I noticed only Sunni was present in class. When I asked her where everyone was, she answered that they were all 'blasting' the **Helmet Gang**. Just as I was about to ask what she meant, a loud explosion echoed from the distance. I rushed to the window and saw a group of kids running away from a burning building. In the middle of the chaos, I saw a kid with a helmet on his head, laughing maniacally as he set fire to the building. That building was way over the horizon, perhaps a few clicks away yet the explosion is as bright as the morning sun.

> It's been two months since the incident. I still can't believe what I saw that day. The kid with the helmet, who I later found out was named Jax, is a **Blast Punk**. He and his gang are notorious for causing chaos and destruction in the city. They are known for their reckless behavior and their love for explosions.

> At this point, I'm kinda accustomed to how things go around here. The kids are always up to something, and the city is always in a state of chaos. But when I examine closer, no one is ever truly hurt. Those explosions were just paint, some gunpowder, and movie magic extravaganza. Nothing like a bit of scolding and grounding won't fix.

> The Head Master also still has not returned from yet. At this point, I wonder if the person ever existed in the first place. It's also interesting how everyone loved Roams Island so much that they haven't thought of going outside yet. But at the same time, everything's here, and perhaps, this uniqueness is something I'll long for when I leave.
