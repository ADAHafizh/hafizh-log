# Welcome to Galactic Century 2179

The Third War was too much for the skies, earth, ocean, and humans to handle. What remains of the Past World gathered as one to form the United Council, which aims to revoke humanities previous sins. After the United Council declared the bannings of all "static" nuclear weapons, the world entered a new era of peace and prosperity. Some parted for the glittering stars amidst the skies while some stayed to walk earth's soil. 

# In this Earth, nukes are soulful creatures

Nuclear weapons are no longer static, cold, and emotionless. They have evolved into soulful creatures that can think, feel, and communicate. They are no longer tools of destruction but rather beings that can coexist with humans. These creatures are called **"Paragons"** and they have their own personalities, emotions, and desires.
