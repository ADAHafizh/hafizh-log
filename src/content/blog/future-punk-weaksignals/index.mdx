# Current Signals

**[Nintendo patents “Summoning” mechanic for their games](https://www.theverge.com/games/779062/nintendo-pokemon-summoning-battle-patent)**

Billion dollar game company Nintendo patents method/implementation of a video game mechanic. The way intellectual property (IP) law, originally meant to protect creativity, is increasingly being used to fence off ideas that arguably should remain part of the public creative commons, raising concerns about the future of creativity and control for developers and designers in respective fields. 

**[How Windows malware looks like in 2025](https://youtu.be/24dfe8q7Aq4?si=yG65obuHCjnpgfuj)** 

Using Windows Defender’s file exception feature to remain invisible, newer generations of computer malware pose a significant threat for users, raising concerns on the need for better, secure, and robust widely used computer systems. In an era where interconnectivity is the main pillar to run the world, what happens when a disruption (i.e [WannaCry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WannaCry_ransomware_attack)) ruins millions of lives. One could presume that more research on computer security would be top priority, but recent end of Windows 10 support potentially heightens this risk as devices are still relying on older systems.

Under the banner of reducing carbon emissions, hot air balloons are once again attempting to take off against the reigning modes of transportation. Its reliability and minimal need for new infrastructure brings hope to the cargo sector. Yet, the challenging development, regulation, and old stigma poses as a tall obstacle that has to be tackled. 

# Uncanny-topia

In the near future, innovation may no longer feel exciting, but strange and unsettling. Nintendo’s recent patent for a “summoning” game mechanic shows how creativity is slowly being locked behind legal walls. Intellectual property laws were originally meant to protect new ideas, but now they are being used to control who gets to be creative. This creates a world where artists, game developers, and designers must compete with giant companies that own even the most basic ideas. Technology has made it easier for anyone to create, but at the same time, corporations are making it harder to freely share or experiment. It feels like creativity is no longer about imagination, but about who has the right to use it.

A similar problem can be seen in how we deal with cybersecurity. Malware in 2025 has become smarter and more invisible, taking advantage of the weaknesses in systems like Windows. Even though we keep hearing that computer security is improving, the reality for most users is different. Big companies often focus more on profit than protection. Windows, for example, has been adding ads and premium features while ending support for older systems. This leaves many users exposed to risks simply because they cannot afford to upgrade. Security, something that should be a basic part of technology, starts to feel like a luxury instead. This shows how our daily lives depend heavily on systems that are not really built for us, but for those who control them.

At the same time, old ideas are returning in new forms. Blimps, or airships, are being reconsidered as an eco-friendly way to move cargo and even people. They promise to cut carbon emissions and offer a slower, more sustainable kind of travel. However, this vision might also repeat the same patterns of inequality we see in other areas. If blimps become expensive or exclusive, they could end up serving only the wealthy, while others are left with outdated, polluting transport. What sounds like a green solution could actually divide people even more, turning sustainability into another symbol of privilege.

When we look at all these signals together, they show a future that feels both advanced and trapped. In this “Uncanny-topia,” progress comes with a strange cost. Creativity is limited by corporate ownership, cybersecurity is shaped by profit, and even green technology could deepen social gaps. It is a world where technology keeps improving, yet people feel less free and less secure. The uncanny part of this future is not the technology itself, but how normal these contradictions have become. We might think we are moving forward, but in some ways, we are only building new walls around ourselves.
