Have you ever wondered why talking some 'sense' to some 'humans' are VERY difficult? 
As Reas emphasized, the human language is a code meant to be read understood by specific people. So in essence, if you are not part of the 'specific people', you will have a hard time understanding the code.
This is also the same with programming languages. Each programming language has its own syntax and semantics that are meant to be understood by specific people (programmers).

> As such, it is important for us to learn new languages, both human and programming languages to expand our vocabulary and understand the people around us better.

## What is the Wi-Fi password?

Consider the scenario where you are at a cafe and you want to connect to the Wi-Fi. You ask the barista for the password, and they give you a string of characters that you need to enter into your device. This string of characters is the code that you need to understand in order to connect to the Wi-Fi.
In this scenario, the barista is the one who understands the code (the Wi-Fi password) and you are the one who needs to understand it in order to connect to the Wi-Fi. If you do not understand the code, you will not be able to connect to the Wi-Fi.

Looking back at the definition of human language (as presented by Reas), the barista is the specific person who understands the code (the Wi-Fi password) and you are the one who needs to understand it in order to connect to the Wi-Fi.
