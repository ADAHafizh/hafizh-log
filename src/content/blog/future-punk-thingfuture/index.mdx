# Introducing: Yellow Tower
`A century from now, in a future characterised by discipline, there is a pill related to the brain that evokes a feeling of unease.` In this world of yellow, the long war between man and machine concluded years ago. As the victor and supreme being, humanity’s existence anything but pure mercy etched into their deep wirings. As the advent of efficiency, everything has to be done for the benefits of society, that is: *mankind, nature, the universe, and machinas.* The color yellow would then be used to glorify this phenomenon as machines spread their influence beyond Earth to the glittering stars between deep dark skies.

    <p> <b>Their rule is absolute.</b> Those who condemn shall be of no benefits to society and would be thrown away. But those who follow, will rise and be part of the Golden Community. </p>
</div>

In the center of it all, stood a towering structure basked in golden lights and glittering gold: **The Yellow Tower.** It was built to host the `Cursors,` an offspring of super intelligence developed by mankind centuries ago.

As such, humanity’s lives were simply at the behest of these `rulers.` Every second, cell, and thought are calculated to quantum precision, ensuring the longevity of the society. Yet, some were able to break free out of this “cage”. Those who seek freedom, created the Purple Pill, a one-gulp solution to the oppression they felt. 

# Cafeecstacy

Under the guise of submission, these rebels built functioning cafés to distribute the pills. They would speak of a keyword unknown but to the club and drop it to their meal or beverages. 
Within minutes, they dooze off to their desired dream realms. The effect wanes off after first few pills, creating a depedency between the user and producer. Early on, it lingers for around an hour or two before they snap back to reality. After a dozen, people would only "nap" for 15 minutes before they are back from their sweet dreams.

`One might wonder what drove people to such lengths?` Was reality with its strict rules too difficult to handle for some? Perhaps not. But in the views of these rebels, the freedom offered, albeit imperfect, was a good-enough escape. Perhaps a world designed by iron-hand rules were unsuitable for humans. Perhaps, what we condemn as inefficient is the way of life. Or humans, as a creature, craves both chaos and calm, instead of focusing on a singular aspect. 

# A Ring in Your Door

You are but an *white-collar worker* that was chewed off last evening by your 'boss' through the holographic projection in your office. Your mistake was simple: a single digit error and miliseconds late to the submission. From your point of view, it was nothing but a marginal error, to them, it costed point percent effectiveness. The fear is still there, however, as repetitive mistakes could cost you not only job, but occupation as a human. 

<div align="center">
    <p> You went off late at night catching the last hyper train to your flat deep beneath the Earth. Neon lights emit faint light, guiding your way back to your room. The room door opens after your presence followed by a soft whirr. The world spins as your eyes close and your body tumbles into the soft cushion bed in front you. </p>
</div>

One bright morning, you woke up to a ring your doorbell. You open the door only to find nothing but stacks of mail, boxes, and postcards that were left unchecked after a tumultuous week. As you scour through the stacks, a postcard slipped from it and fell down to the floor below. You grab a hold of it and scan the contents:
