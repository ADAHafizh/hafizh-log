# Cozy + Corner + Lily = ???

`???` was the the first impression that I got after hitting the word on [Random Word Generator](https://randomwordgenerator.com/). Coincidence? I think not! But even after getting the word last week (at around Thursday-ish), I had zero idea what I was going to do for this prototype. That is, until the discussion I had with Professor [Khulood Alawadi](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/engineering/faculty/khulood-alawadi.html) on Tuesday. Before I recap the discussion, let's take a look at this week's prototype first:
