# DC Motor and Potentiometers. 

For this week's testing with DC Motor, I found it intriguing with some problems that came along with it, and somehow the method to fixing it just *works?* Anyhow, I began by continuing off from last week's code when the machine was working fine. Then, I added a potentiometer to `control the speed` and `direction.` 

Initially, after tweaking some parts of the code to fit the potentiometer, the motor suddenly stopped working and had no sounds coming off of it. When I checked the potentiometer using `Serial.write`, I noticed that it was jumping up and down in a weird fashion. Somewhere afterwards, I changed the potentiometer and/or then plugged it directly into the Arduino board to see if it would fix anything.

Funny enough, this caused some weird movement and whirring sounds when plugged (and tried with the new code). Then, I fiddled around with the input locations both in code and wiring, and somehow it worked??? Not sure how this turned out to be.

# DIY Conveyor Belt

Unfortunately the IM Lab does not have rubber bands. Fortunately, the place is also filled with dozens of substitute materials. And even more fortunately, we are here to be challenged and face them. 

In the morning, I saw a [YouTube short](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/eBiscwtcVJg) where the video shows a vertical conveyor belt / elevator system. In it, I notice that most of the structures were made with wood and perhaps cardboard, a.k.a soft materials. What caught my attention was the trick part to create elastic enough materials to allow the belt to work. Inspired by this, I cut up some paper and began working on the conveyor system.
