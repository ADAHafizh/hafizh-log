# A World Then

I've always wondered: `what's so hard about using that new e-commerce store like Amazon, or that new food delivery app like Talabat?` To recontextualize this question, I just wanna throw back to the reason I entered this major in the first place. My mother, who grew up generations before me, after using her smartphone (that is an iPhone) for years once in a while always asks me how to use new apps. At one point when I came back home, she just said: 

> "Yeah, I waited an entire year just so that you can help me with this app."

After reviewing a glimpse of machine technology history, one thing came to my mind: the world was living in [analog](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/analog) for as long as centuries, molding cultures, values, and norms, until suddenly these things called `"machines"` emerged one *sunny* day and tumbled those normals like a falling house of cards. As a creature born when these inventions are the normals, my mind is shaped to behave and interact with them. But as someone who got to know it in the middle of their lives, it probably feels like meeting a new colleague that you have to spend working with for the rest of your life.

    <p> To emphasize, machines had to become the norms as the world progresses. This necessity <b>confused</b> many, and discourses are still very much active in <i>(many if not all)</i> fields. </p>

# iPhone(s) vs, Tupperware

What's even more confusing is how `fragile` this machine is. It is an object built with a very focused intention, mostly a tool for specific tasks, and cannot not adapt willingly unless built to be so. `Until it does more: which brings us to smartphones.` In the span of less than a century, we were able to send humans to space with giant non-organic brain computers (machines to calculate) and compresses multiple of these machines into a singular object. Imagine having to adapt to stages of these technologies? Oh, the irony! Yet despite being an apex of every machines that precedes it, we see newer smartphones being released every single year. That as a cherry on top, we have found a way to generate commodity out of this confusion: **the digital culture.**

> Digital culture is embedded in a large pile of network wires, lines, routers, switches, and other very material things that, as Jonathan Sterne acutely and bluntly states, “will be trashed.” Far from being accidental, discarding and obsolescence are in fact internal to contemporary media technologies. As Sterne argues, the logic of new media does not only mean the replacement of old media by new media but that digital culture is loaded with the assumption and expectation of a short-term forthcoming obsolescence. There is always a better laptop or mobile phone on the horizon: new media always become old.
