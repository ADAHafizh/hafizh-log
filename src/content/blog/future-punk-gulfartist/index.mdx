# Recalibrating our Culture Anchor 

## Steampunk

Although I cannot call myself a devout "steampunker", I very much enjoy narratives and world building on this specific vision of alternate realities. Partially because I do not find tall skyscrapers shrouded in thousand-glimmering neon lights to be enticing compared to mechanical whirrs, clanks, and lung filling steam, but `because it is an era we will never see again. `

Unhinged take but our world today takes shape after modernism and standardism in the sense that a lot of things are shaping from this culture. Most of the ideas came from the West, and through long history, is applied in almost every inch of the world with varying "success". **Take for example McDonalds. **All across the globe, they have transformed from a red-yellow playful hunger-grabbing food sites into a souless concrete structure with a yellow "M" sign posted somewhere in the vicinity.

Knowing this, it also applies to steampunk in the discourse that steampunk works are often set in an alternative history of the Victorian era or the American frontier where steam power remains in mainstream use, or in a fantasy world that similarly employs steam power. Authors like Jules Verne, H. G. Wells, Mary Shelley, and Edward S. Ellis contributed to the popularity of the genre. But just because the idea popularized in the "West", does not mean the "East" have no `steampunk.`

I took a look into *Beyond Victoriana's* question based on this [post](https://beyondvictoriana.com/2011/06/19/80-shadi-ghadirian-muslim-women-time-travelers/):

    <p> If nineteenth-century Iranian women discovered time travel, where would they go? What would they bring back? </p>

The first thought that came to my mind was `when?`, simply because the time assuming was following our current timeline would create very interesting dynamics. Think about the war, the conflicts, and everything that the people had to experience that changed the values of a very deeply rooted community. But looping back to the idea behind Beyond Victoriana, I think this was a very peculiar one. It's just that paralel-ly, steampunk has a very ingrained definition already through scenes and imaginatives from the West that calling some of the East to be also steampunk takes bravery. 

## Gulf x Oil

Questioning about the future of the Gulf, oil comes into my mind. One way to ask is tapping in realms of relationship between gulf and oil. Before it was found, while, and present day implications. Artists Rania Ghosn and El Hadi Jazairy in [After Oil](https://manazir.art/blog/posts/nostalgia-and-belonging-art-and-architecture-mena-region/petroleummelancholia-ecologies-gulf-futurism-work-design-earth-tschuppert) engaged me in this discourse.
