# Re-thinking Fluid

When we were discussing on how to improve visuals for our capstone, we were hell bent on doing two things: a) make space, cosmic-ish particles, or b) fluid simulation. For this week, I am trying out by mimicking / branching off last semester's visuals with fluid wave simulation. The concept that I found interesting to implement for this week was loosely based off [Voronoi Cells](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/VoronoiDiagram.html) or [Diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram). 

> The partitioning of a plane with `n` points into convex polygons such that each polygon contains exactly one generating point and every point in a given polygon is closer to its generating point than to any other. A Voronoi diagram is sometimes also known as a Dirichlet tessellation. The cells are called **Dirichlet regions, Thiessen polytopes, or Voronoi polygons** (from Wolfram Mathworld)
