# Smarter State Machines

Continuing from previous post, I've redone the way I implement the state machine moving forward. This time, I used Touchdesigner's [network](https://derivative.ca/UserGuide/Network) systems output and selecting them through user input that is determined by a group of CHOPs. For summary, essentially I split the workload into three modules: 

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: center; gap: 5px;">

</div> 

- **State Controllers:** The brain that determines and knows what state entire network is, controlled (for now) with `keyboard input.` Will be using real-time data stream from sensors in the future.  
- **Visual Network:** The place where I assemble all of the visuals, they can be entered through scrolling. Each are independent with one another.
- **Preview Node:** A node that allows the user to see what is the current and next selection of visual.

# Visuals: Idle, Calm, Active prototypes

## Idle 

When the audience looks at the space, they will be greeted with a "living" voronoi waves from previous prototype that I have adjusted the colors and behavior such that it is attractive and active enough to be noticed by the audience. Originally, it had a dark color background, but considering the color palette we've discussed for the "calm" state, `I tried experimenting with making sure that the audience's eyes don't get flashbang-ed.`

## Active State

This state is still very much work in progress because I've got a lot of ideas on what to do with it just not implementing it right now. But borrowing Yaakulya's space obsession, I made something akin to the sun's surface layer with colors borrowing from idle and calm states. This visual mostly rely on [Edge TOPs](https://derivative.ca/UserGuide/Edge_TOP) and [Displace TOPs](https://docs.derivative.ca/Displace_TOP) to create an overlapping sphere with added noise to offset it, creating something akin to a [sun's flare.](https://www.space.com/17160-sun-atmosphere.html)

## Calm State

Following the orb as a center piece and glowing golden "vibes" from the visual inspiration deck, I went a very subtle wavy moving gradient. On top of that, I added a math function through [Pattern CHOP](https://derivative.ca/UserGuide/Pattern_CHOP) to control the motion of the bubbles. They are independent from one another, which means, using data stream from websocket (hooray 😎), many parameters can be adjusted to fit our needs.
