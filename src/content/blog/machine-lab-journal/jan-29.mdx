# Servo & Potentiometer

This assignment was a really great refresher for me on servos, circuits, and Arduino programming. Essentially, how the program works is that by default, `Servo library` does not have a speed control. Which means to get a speed, we need to have the rotation of the servo divided by certain amount of time to reach it. In other words, we need a clock counter (something akin to blink without delay), gain the potentiometer values, map it, and then apply that to the Sweeper class.
