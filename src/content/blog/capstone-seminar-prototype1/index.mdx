# About Prototype

For this week, I created a simple miniature room using cardboard, paper, and foam. The room includes a few furniture with crude shapes. The main focus of this prototype is to see how the lighting works in a small enclosed space, and prepare an adjustable model for my next prototypes.

# Process

Initially, I wanted to create a fully fledged room with scaled furniture and detailed decorations. However, I realized that it would take too much time to create and I wasn't sure whether it would be functional the way I wanted it to be. In addition, there is only a limited amount of foam in the IM Lab so I had to be clever in using the materials. Therefore, I decided to create a simple room with crude furniture shapes and focus on the lighting aspect.

**Why the lighting?** Since our project will mainly focus on using lights, whether it is projection mapping or LED lights, I needed a miniature model where I can test these things out without having the hustle of creating a full scale room. Second, this prototype is a "testing the water" kind of prototype, where I can experiment with different layouts and materials.
