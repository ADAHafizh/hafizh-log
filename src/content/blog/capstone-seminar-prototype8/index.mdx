# Projection Prep 

I've ping-ponged emails back and forth to EC and IM Lab regarding equipment borrowing and it was such a mess this week. Plus for some reason I forgot this is `the` week when all four classes stack on top of another in deadlines so I was pretty much dead. Regarding borrowing, I've contacted Dustin and confirmed a fix on my part at least. I've also contacted Stefania and we're planning to hang things by next week which also means there's not really a lot of things to move or squeeze around in our small space.

Knowing that we are going to track from the top, I've prepared a backup method and practiced with something called [Blobtracking](https://opencv.org/blog/blob-detection-using-opencv/). In computer vision, detecting blobs(regions) that differ from their surroundings is a common and powerful technique. A blob can be as simple as a spot of light in an image or as complex as a moving object in a video. `This matters because we are going to look from the top using our depth cameras, hence we need to distinguish between heads, floor projection, and floor surface.`
