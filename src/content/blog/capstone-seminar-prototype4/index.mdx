# Cozy + Corner + Lily = ???

`???` was the the first impression that I got after hitting the word on [Random Word Generator](https://randomwordgenerator.com/). Coincidence? I think not! But even after getting the word last week (at around Thursday-ish), I had zero idea what I was going to do for this prototype. That is, until the discussion I had with Professor [Khulood Alawadi](https://nyuad.nyu.edu/en/academics/divisions/engineering/faculty/khulood-alawadi.html) on Tuesday. Before I recap the discussion, let's take a look at this week's prototype first:

<div align="center">

        <figcaption> Projection on Flat Wall</figcaption>

        <figcaption> Close-up </figcaption>
    </figure>                 
</div>

Essentially the way this prototype works is by `"confusing"` the audience first when they arrive at the space. The projection is a design by [Noto](https://kohui.xyz/About), so I  did not delve in TouchDesigner this week (sadge emote here) albeit using it. The focus of this week's prototype is to **try as best as possible to capture the vibes we are going for in the final product,** plus adding some flavors of the keyword here and there.

### New: Texture and Smell

This prototype focuses on supplying the audience with more than just visuals by integrating touch and scemt into the space. It is unfortunate that I was unable to get actual lilies or scents, but the keyword did gave me an idea to use something that the audience can `interact with.` So here's how it works:

<div align="center">
    <p>The audience will arrive at the scene looking at the swirling chaos in front (or top) of them. As they approach closer to the area, they will start to smell scents coming from diffuser. By the time they reach the diffuser, an object (baloon in this case) is present for them touch. <b>By squishing the oobleck baloon, we hope that the audience will feel satisfaction after being sensory blasted.</b></p>
</div>

# What did I learn?

From this simple prototype, there's a few things that I learned which could be crucial for things going forward:
- **To paint light, you must be in the darkness.** Something that I did not anticipate beforehand is how light works in a (almost) completely dark room. The first thing that came into my mind is what if the audience is afraid of the dark? Think about all the emotions invoked from a dark room. Second, the projector was bright enough to lit up the entire corners and desk and whatnots. Think about how the light bounces, and the warmth/cold it has could allow super different vibe. 
- **Impress within three seconds.** When my suitemate arrived from the outside, the first reaction he got was like: `"the frick?"` and before spotting me in the corner he approached the baloons but did not touch them. Because the room is dark, the balloons were not visible enough and there was not incentive to touch it. After spotting me would then he began asking questions. Instructions in this case is important for the users to be able to experience without asking questions. 
- **Feedback.** What happens when the user does something? In this prototype, because of the pressing time (since I have to do it at night while my roomies are away and dark environment), providing a reaction from the user's action is a must. I did not have it this time, so the impression was like "meh" coming from them.
