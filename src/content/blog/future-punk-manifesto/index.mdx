# Welcome to Galactic Century 2179

The Third War was too much for the skies, earth, ocean, and humans to handle. What remains of the Past World gathered as one to form the United Council, which aims to revoke humanities previous sins.

Some parted for the glittering stars amidst the skies while some stayed to walk earth's soil.
